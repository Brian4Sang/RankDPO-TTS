# Style-Aware RankDPO
Official implementation of the paper  
**‚ÄúStyle-Aware RankDPO for Stable Speech Synthesis‚Äù (ICASSP 2026, under review)** 

[Demos](https://fun-audio-llm.github.io); [Paper](https://funaudiollm.github.io/pdf/CosyVoice_v1.pdf); [Modelscope](https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/iic/CosyVoice-300M), 

these framework is used for post-SFT fine-tuning and implemented upon:

**CosyVoice 2.0**: [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10117); [Modelscope](https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/iic/CosyVoice2-0.5B); [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice2-0.5B)

## Overview

This repository provides the implementation of **RankDPO**, a listwise preference optimization method for speech alignment,  
and **ChatScorer**, a learned reward model designed to evaluate **style consistency** and **natural conversational behavior** in TTS systems.

**Key ideas:**  
- RankDPO extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to *listwise* training, allowing the model to leverage full ranking information across multiple candidate audios.  
- Meanwhile, ChatScorer predicts naturalness and conversational style while removing speaker bias via a GRL-based adversarial branch.

## Highlightüî•

-  **Listwise preference optimization (RankDPO)** ‚Äî efficiently exploits ranking information from multiple samples per prompt.  
-  **ChatScorer reward model** ‚Äî trained to measure *style stability* and *speaker-independent naturalness*.  
-  **Better style control** ‚Äî reduces ‚Äúmachine-like‚Äù or unstable utterances in conversational TTS.  
-  **Modular training framework** ‚Äî supports DPO, RankDPO, and DiffRO variants under a unified pipeline.  

## Install

### Clone and install

- Clone the repo
    ``` sh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Brian4Sang/RankDPO-TTS.git
    cd RankDPO-TTS
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

- Install Conda: please see https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
- Create Conda env:

    ``` sh
    conda create -n rankdpo -y python=3.10
    conda activate rankdpo
    # pynini is required by WeTextProcessing, use conda to install it as it can be executed on all platforms.
    conda install -y -c conda-forge pynini==2.1.5
    pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ --trusted-host=mirrors.aliyun.com
    
    # If you encounter sox compatibility issues
    # ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install sox libsox-dev
    # centos
    sudo yum install sox sox-devel
    ```

### Cosyvoice2 Model download

We strongly recommend that you download their pretrained `CosyVoice2-0.5B` model and `CosyVoice-ttsfrd` resource.

``` python
# SDKÊ®°Âûã‰∏ãËΩΩ
from modelscope import snapshot_download
snapshot_download('iic/CosyVoice2-0.5B', local_dir='pretrained_models/CosyVoice2-0.5B')
snapshot_download('iic/CosyVoice-ttsfrd', local_dir='pretrained_models/CosyVoice-ttsfrd')
```

``` sh
# gitÊ®°Âûã‰∏ãËΩΩÔºåËØ∑Á°Æ‰øùÂ∑≤ÂÆâË£Ögit lfs
mkdir -p pretrained_models
git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/iic/CosyVoice2-0.5B.git pretrained_models/CosyVoice2-0.5B
git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/iic/CosyVoice-ttsfrd.git pretrained_models/CosyVoice-ttsfrd
```

Optionally, you can unzip `ttsfrd` resource and install `ttsfrd` package for better text normalization performance.

Notice that this step is not necessary. If you do not install `ttsfrd` package, we will use WeTextProcessing by default.

``` sh
cd pretrained_models/CosyVoice-ttsfrd/
unzip resource.zip -d .
pip install ttsfrd_dependency-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
pip install ttsfrd-0.4.2-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```
